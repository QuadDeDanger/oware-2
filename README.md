| -------------------------- |:--------------:| 
|Report |	A bit left/Will wait for view
|JUnit	| AI/BasicComputerPlayer left (Haaris working on it)|
|Commenting/javadoc ! | All view classes/Will wait for view|
|Change PLayer 2 to Player as default name | Ajeya working on it |
|Code cleanup | Comment out printlns in View|
|Package cleanup (images) | Remove seed.gif/Will wait for view|
|Player turn GUI	| Ajeya working on it |
|Set minimum sizes of frames | Will wait for view|
|Animations | Ajeya working on it |
|Design (houses, seeds, player won/lost)	| Ajeya working on it |
|The application may include an AI player, using a basic search algorithm that explores all combinations of possible future moves up to a very limited number of moves, and identifies the best possible move for the AI player assuming the opponent also makes optimal moves for the opponent. It is extremely challenging to add this to the project in a single week and it does not affect your mark by much.| Yes |
| Computer choosing 0 bug | Yes  |
| Force end | Yes |
| In two player mode, the game selects a random player to make the first move.  | Yes |
| The application must be able to display the initial board. | Yes |
| The game must display the number of seeds in each house, either using images or numbers. It is not required to hide the number of seeds in a house from an opponent. | Yes |
| The application must be able to redistribute seeks according to the rules of the game. When selecting a house with 12 or more seeds, the starting house should be skipped as specified in the rules. | Yes |
| The application must implement the capture rule correctly, including the prohibition on capturing all of the opponent's seeds. Capture moves are not applicable to the player's own houses. | Yes |
| The application must recognise when one player has won the game. | Yes |
| The application must implement the rule that if the opponent has no seeds, and one or more moves is/are possible that gives the opponent seeds, then only such moves are permitted. |  Yes |
|The application should include a basic single player mode. A basic single player mode is very easy to implement: just get the computer player to make random moves.| Yes |
